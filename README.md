# ALL OF MY VIDEOGAMES

One of my first memories was playing PacMan on my family's N64 and accidentally pulling the whole game system off the TV stand, **crashing onto my little 4 year old toes** (back when game controllers were wired).

Thus began a lifelong toxic relationship between me and videogames; eventually leading me to graduate with a BA in Game Design and then never work in the game industry.

Nonetheless, I've compiled all my games that made it out of development hell and to the golden gates of deployment.

Enjoy.
